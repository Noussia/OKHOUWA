// Dear programmer

// When I wrote this code, only god and I knew how it worked \
// Now, only god knows it!

// Therefore, if you are trying to optimize this routine and it fails (most surely) \
// please increase this counter as a warning for the next person: \
// total _hours_wasted_here = 254

// On a more serious note, I want to emphasize that this Git repository is primarily intended for mutual support. \
// If you come across any errors in the code or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to share your feedback. \
// You can do so by commenting directly on the code or by submitting a new commit with your proposed modifications. \

// Good luck :)
